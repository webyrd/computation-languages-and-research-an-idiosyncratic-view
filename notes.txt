It’s finally time to start a project I’ve been thinking about for at least 7 years, probably longer.

A series of books starting from no programming experience and going all the way up to being able to do research in PL and write papers.

Current contender for the overall title:

***
Computation, Languages, and Research: An Idiosyncratic View
by William E. Byrd

(this one seems honest and direct--I like it!)

Computation, Programming, Languages, Research, and What-Have-You: An Idiosyncratic View
Computation, Programming, Languages, Research, and What-Have-You:
An Idiosyncratic Uncourse by Will Byrd
An Idiosyncratic Approach to Computation, Programming, Languages, Research, and What-Have-You

An Imperishable Wonderland of Infinite Fun

Focused, not surprisingly, on the things I know best—Scheme and relational programming, but including plenty of there things such as types and proof assistants or automated theorem proving and what-have-you.

How to get started?

TODO:

* create new github repo
(after a little thought, I think this series of books should be in its own repo, and should not be part of the Imperishable Wonderland repo)

* start outlining the volumes, and what will be in each volume (see `outline.md`)

* start thinking about the "writing rules" for the series (see `writing-rules.md`)
