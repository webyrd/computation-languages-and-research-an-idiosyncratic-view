Writing Rules for 'Computation, Languages, and Research: An Idiosyncratic View'

* I plan to work on all of these books simultaneously, of course, for good or for bad!  At least this should help me with the dependencies, since I can "work backwards" if I want, add sections to the first book and the last book simultaneously, etc.

* work in the open

* CC-BY 4.0 International license

* Stick with pandoc and Markdown.  I'm not super happy with the PDF output from pandoc so far, but Markdown is easy to work with, accessible, and I don't spend all my time messing around with LaTeX typesetting.  Maybe I can at least adjust the margins for PDF output from pandoc---the margins are so huge!
