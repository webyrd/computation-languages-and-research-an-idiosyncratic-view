Writing Rules for 'Computation, Languages, and Research: An Idiosyncratic View'

* I plan to work on all of these books simultaneously, of course, for good or for bad!  At least this should help me with the dependencies, since I can "work backwards" if I want, add sections to the first book and the last book simultaneously, etc.

* work in the open

* CC-BY 4.0 International license

* Stick with pandoc and Markdown.  I'm not super happy with the PDF output from pandoc so far, but Markdown is easy to work with, accessible, and I don't spend all my time messing around with LaTeX typesetting.  Maybe I can at least adjust the margins for PDF output from pandoc---the margins are so huge!

* Idiosyncratic, personal point of view.  Not an encyclopedia of everything that could be taught or explored in computing (as if I could even write such a thing).

* Trajectory, coherence, point-of-view, and intellectual stance are important---much more important than trying to replace a CS undergrad/grad program.

* Assumption is that the learner will learn from many resources other than this Uncourse.  This Uncourse can provide an arc/trajectory/way of looking at computation, programming, programming languages, research, etc., that is unique, and that can't be discovered by taking a bunch of individual classes/reading individual books on specific technical topics by a bunch of people.

* Show what is fascinating, weird, bizarre, inspiring, IMHO.

* Scheme, miniKanren/relational programming, my personal approach to research and thinking and communication, should all shine through.

* My personal communication style and personality and sense of fun and humor should also shine through.

* Light a fire, don't fill a bucket.
