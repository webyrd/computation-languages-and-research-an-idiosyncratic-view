Outline for 'Computation, Languages, and Research: An Idiosyncratic View'

I'm currently assuming that I'll write this as a series of books, perhaps 5 books.

I want to have a book that is called someting like: `Scheme: A Hacker's Dream`.

An overview of programming languages, paradigms, etc.

A discussion of languages that are Hacker's Dreams: Forth, Haskell, Lisps, Prolog, APL/J/K etc.  And languages that change your view of programming.

Perlis's Epigrams on Programming -- sprinkle though at the right points

R6RS training arc -- how might that fit in?  Reading a spec is definitely something important!

Self-reliance: Skills and Attitude for -- Uncourse should be based on this, to the greatest possible extent

Language design

Reading a paper, and implementing the ideas/algorithms/rules in the paper

Giving a talk

Writing a paper

Reviewing a paper
