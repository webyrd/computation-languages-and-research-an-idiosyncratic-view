Outline for 'Computation, Languages, and Research: An Idiosyncratic View'

Need a 'Training Plan', dependencies, resources, etc.

Is N books, from simpler to more advanced, the right way to think about things?  Could I use the power of hyper links to build something more dynamic?  Or even integrate an LLM and software and online running of code/whatever (the 'Primer' from Diamond Age, for example)?  Choose your own adventure style?  Maybe that style is good---could have pre-tests, etc.  The `Quick Caculus` book I am currently reading works that way.

How to think about this?  If someone came to me with no experience in programming or computing, and asked me, "I hear this stuff is fascinating---please show me!", what would I show them?  Also, if someone came to me and said, "I want to do research with you---what do I need to know?  Please show me!", what would I show them?  Or, if someone came to me and said, "I hear Scheme/Lisp is powerful, but it looks to me like it is just a teaching language for babies", what would I show them?  Or if someone said, "this Barliman thingy looks super cool, but all I know is a little Java/Python/whatever. What do I need to learn?", what would I show them?

Okay to start with the minimal dependencies of ideas starting from nothing to research in mk.  Assumption is that the learner will fill in the many, many gaps from other sources (I'll point out many resources, of course).  Anything non-standard I will definitely show.  For things like compilers I might delegate them to the IU course and accompanying book, for example.  Include exercises (read TLS, or read certain chapters of a book and do the exercises, might be the meta-exercises!), and also have an overall Training Plan.

I'm currently assuming that I'll write this as a series of books, perhaps 5 books.

I want to have a book that is called someting like: `Scheme: A Hacker's Dream`.

An overview of programming languages, paradigms, etc.

A discussion of languages that are Hacker's Dreams: Forth, Haskell, Lisps, Prolog, APL/J/K etc.  And languages that change your view of programming.

Perlis's Epigrams on Programming -- sprinkle though at the right points

R6RS training arc -- how might that fit in?  Reading a spec is definitely something important!

Self-reliance: Skills and Attitude for -- Uncourse should be based on this, to the greatest possible extent

Language design

Reading a paper, and implementing the ideas/algorithms/rules in the paper

Giving a talk

Writing a paper

Reviewing a paper
